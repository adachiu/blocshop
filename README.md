This is our team introduction page for the [hack.summit() Virtual Hackathon] (https://www.koding.com/Hackathon "hack.summit() Virtual Hackathon")

## Update ##
We didn't get to submit our project, but **we learned a lot** from the whole experience and we intend to finish it as a side project. Our team encountered numerous technical challenges with [Koding](https://Koding.com/ "Koding") One of which was the constant termination of collaboration sessions. Our team member had to frequently re-invite each of us to his VM. On top of this annoying occurrence, the Koding IDE was glitchy at times and it forced us to restart the VM. In retrospect, we think there were probably better ways to collaborate more efficiently.

### TL;DR ... this is one screenshot to summarize our first hackathon experience. ###
