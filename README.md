This is our team introduction page for the [hack.summit() Virtual Hackathon] (https://www.koding.com/Hackathon "hack.summit() Virtual Hackathon")

## Update ##
We didn't get to submit our project, but **we learned a lot** from the whole experience and we intend to finish it as a side project. Our team encountered numerous technical challenges with [Koding](https://Koding.com/ "Koding") One of which was the constant termination of collaboration sessions. Our team member had to frequently re-invite each of us to his VM. On top of this annoying occurrence, the Koding IDE was glitchy at times and it forced us to restart the VM. In retrospect, we think there were probably better ways to collaborate more efficiently.

To be fair, we could not entirely blame Koding for our inability to finish our project. We could have better managed our time and made design tradeoffs in order to complete the project before the deadline. Nonetheless, I'm very proud of our team and we did good considering that this was our first hackathon experience.

### TL;DR ... this is one screenshot to summarize our first hackathon experience. ###
